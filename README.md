# Titriste Game ðŸŽ®

**Titriste** is a project developed in C++ as part of the Data Structures course at ENSET. It combines classic Tetris-inspired gameplay with additional strategic mechanics like color and shape-based shifts and removals. This README provides installation instructions, features, and insights into the development process.

## Features

- **ASCII Art Gameplay**: Play the game visually in the terminal with ASCII-based graphics.
- **Strategic Piece Insertion**: Insert pieces either on the left or right of the game board for optimal placement.
- **Color and Shape Matching**: Remove three consecutive pieces of the same color or shape.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for removing pieces, with bonuses for complex actions.
- **Game Over Logic**: The game ends when more than 15 pieces are present on the board.
- **High Scores**: Scores are saved in a text file for players to track their achievements.
- **Graphical Interface**: An optional graphical version implemented using the SFML library.
